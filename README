Cryptolib is a cryptographic library for Arduino.

Secure hashing
  Produces a short message hash with cryptographic properties. It is computationally unfeasible to generate messages with the same hash, or determine the contents of a message from its hash.
  Algorithms supported: SHA-1, SHA-256

Hashed message authentication
  Produces a short message hash with cryptographic properties from a message and secure key.
  Algorithms supported: HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256


Library verification
  Verification code is included in the example sketches.
  SHA-1: FIPS 180-2, RFC3174 compliant
  HMAC-SHA-1: FIPS 198a compliant
  SHA-256: FIPS 180-2, RFC4231 compliant
  HMAC-SHA-256:  RFC4231 compliant
